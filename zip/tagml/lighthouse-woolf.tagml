[p|T n=1>
[line|D>[s|T n=1>It grew darker.<s|T] [s|T n=2>Clouds covered the moon; in the early<line|D] [line|D>hours of the morning a thin rain drummed on the roof, and<line|D] [line|D>starlight and moonlight and all light on sky and earth was<line|D] [line|D>quenched.<s|T] [s|T n=3>Nothing could survive the flood, the profusion,<line|D] [line|D>the downpouring of the immense darkness which, creeping in at<line|D] [line|D>keyholes and crevices, stole round the window blinds, came in<line|D] [line|D>to the bedrooms, and swallowed up, here a jug and basin, there<line|D] [line|D>a bowl of red and yellow dahlias, there the sharp edges and<line|D] [line|D>firm bulk of a chest of drawers.<s|T] [s|T n=4>Not only was furniture<line|D] [line|D>confounded; but there was scarcely anything left of body or<line|D] [line|D>mind by which one could say 'this is he' or 'this is she'; but<line|D] [line|D>from the many bodies lying asleep either in the rigid attitudes<line|D] [line|D>of the old passively creased in the creases of the beds, or<line|D] [line|D>easily lying scarcely covered, in childhood, as if a cloud<line|D] [line|D>lightly curved under them, there rose, to break silvery on the<line|D] [line|D>surface, thoughts, dreams, impulses, of which the sleepers by<line|D] [line|D>day knew nothing.<s|T] [s|T n=5>Now a hand was raised as if to clutch<line|D] [line|D>something or perhaps ward off something; now the anguish which<line|D] [line|D>is forbidden to cry out for comfort parted the lips of the<line|D] [line|D>sleepers; now and then somebody laughed out loud, as if sharing<line|D] [line|D>a joke with nothingness.<line|D]<s|T]<p|T]
[line|D>[p|T n=2>[s|T n=6>It seemed almost as if there must be ghostly confidantes<line|D] [line|D>about, sharers, comforters, who, stooping by the bedside,<line|D] 
[line|D>gravely treasured up and engulphed in the folds of their<line|D] [line|D>cloaks, in their compassionate hearts, what was murmured and<line|D] [line|D>cried, accepted and understood those changes from torture to<line|D] [line|D>calm, from hate to indifference, which came and went and came<line|D] [line|D>again upon the sleeper's faces.<s|T] [s|T n=7>It seemed, at least, as if<line|D] [line|D>each reached out and found standing at the foot of his bed the<line|D] [line|D>counterpart of his thoughts, the sharer of his deeds, found in<line|D] [line|D>sleep a completeness denied him by day, and to that cried and to<line|D] [line|D>that confided and laughed the senseless wild laughter which, had<line|D] [line|D>the waking heard it, would have startled them.<s|T] [s|T n=8>To each a<line|D] [line|D>sharer, to each thought an answer, and in this knowledge content -<line|D] [line|D>it might be so.<s|T] [s|T n=9>It might be that dreaming and sleeping each<line|D] [line|D>put off the cumber and trouble of flesh and left the house and<line|D] [line|D>paced the beach and asked of the wave and the sky: is the sharp-<line|D][line|D>edged furniture all, and the flowers; is the day all; is our<line|D] [line|D>duty to the day?<line|D]<s|T]<p|T]
[line|D>[p|T>[s|T n=10>The waves breaking seemed like night shaking her head back<line|D] [line|D>and letting despairingly her dark down, and musing and mourning<line|D] [line|D>as if she lamented the doom which drowned the earth and extin<line|D][line|D>guished its lights and of all ships and towns left nothing.<line|D]<s|T]<p|T]<chapter|T]
