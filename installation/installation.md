## Preparation

### Technical requirements

**Corpus**: During the workshop, we will work with a small corpus of texts and an XSLT template to generate HTML. The corpus is prepared in advance by the instructors in order to streamline the tutorial exercises. 

**Hardware**: Participants must bring laptops with Windows/Mac OS X/Linux (No iOS / ChromeOS / Surface devices)

**Software**: Install [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and the [custom TAGML syntax highlighting package](https://huygensing.github.io/tagml-sublime-syntax/). Sublime Text 3 is a cross-platform editor that has syntax highlighting for TAGML.

**Command Line Practice**: While prior knowledge of command line is not required, we recommend [SW Carpentry's Tutorial on the Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) if you would like to familiarize yourself ahead of time.
