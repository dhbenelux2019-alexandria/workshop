    "\n",
    "1. What are the properties, strengths, and limitations of the format you are converting to? What are the consequences for the information you are converting? For example: if you are converting to XML, your text will be transformed in a hierarchical tree structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What do you want to do with the exported file? Is it going to be a PNG or SVG file for visualisation, an XML file for further analysis or publication, etc. In short: what are the reasons for converting? \n",
